Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

Requirements:
Using your knowledge of R, design a statistical study to compare performance of the MechaCar vehicles against performance of vehicles from other manufacturers.
Address the following questions:
	•	What metric or metrics are you going to test?
	•	What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
	•	What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
	•	What data is needed to run the statistical test?

Metrics
Collecting data for comparable models across all major manufacturers for past 3 years for the following metrics:
	•	Safety Feature Rating: Independent Variable
	•	Selling Price: Dependent Variable
	•	MPG: Independent Variable
	•	Resale Value: Independent Variable
	•	Maintenance: Independent Variable

Hypothesis: Null and Alternative
	•	Null Hypothesis: MechaCar’s mpg is standard for the engine and features that it has. 
	•	Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): MechaCar’s MPG is not standard given the engine and features it has.

Stats Tests
A multiple linear regression would be used toes the factors that have the greatest correlation or the similarities between the MechaCar and the competitor. In this case, we would be testing for the MPG along side with the engine size too to see what would cause differences between both.
